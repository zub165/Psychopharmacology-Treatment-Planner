## REFERENCE IMAGE EXTRACT
(The following antidepressant classifications were sourced from the image provided)

### Antidepressant Medications

#### ALLEVIATE DEFICIENCIES OF SEROTONIN, NOREPINEPHRINE, & DOPAMINE

#### TOXICITY NOTE

Antidepressants may cause Serotonin Syndrome, a condition caused by excess serotonin in the synapses
of the brain. Symptoms include confusion, fever, hallucinations, agitation, abdominal pain, and tremors.

Antidepressant medications may take four to six weeks to have noticeable therapeutic effects. Do not abruptly
stop taking antidepressants, and avoid consumption of alcohol while on an antidepressant medication regimen.

#### SUMMARY OF ANTIDEPRESSANT CLASSES:
- Atypical Antidepressants: Bupropion, Mirtazapine, Trazodone, etc.
- SSRIs: Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Paroxetine, Citalopram, Escitalopram, Fluvoxamine
- SNRIs: Venlafaxine, Desvenlafaxine, Duloxetine
- MAOIs: Isocarboxazid, Phenelzine, Selegiline, Tranylcypromine
- Tricyclics: Nortriptyline, Amitriptyline, Doxepin

#### CLINICAL WARNING:
All antidepressants may cause Serotonin Syndrome and take 4-6 weeks to show benefit. 
Do not abruptly stop medications or mix MAOIs with other agents.
